# Going Home
Game created for the [GBJam2023](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-11).
Itch.io page: https://adrimb.itch.io/going-home (Web and Windows versions are available)

We created the full game, the art, the sound and all the levels in just 10 days. We have used Godot for the creation of the game as part of learning how to use the engine
